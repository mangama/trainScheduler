# trainScheduler



## Instructions

Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:

* When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    _   Train Name
    _   Destination 
    _   First Train Time -- in military time
    _   Frequency -- in minutes
* Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
* Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
* Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
* Submission: Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!
* Commits: Be clear and descriptive in your commit messaging.
